                Fish need a lot of time to take care of.  They need food to survive.  Water only is not a food for them so please not think water is enough for them to survive.  
                You should record them because they do not live forever and it would be nice to keep it in memory.  In addition, put some toys for them so they would not get bored.

                Most people give them fish food from the stores.  You can give them algae wafers and flake foods.  They can eat vegetables such as
                zucchini, peas, lettuce and spinach.  Vegetables are full of the minerals and vitamins.  They can also eat small amounts of fruit 
                including apples and pears.  But the best food for them is homemade fish food.  It can save your time and money.
